# patch

A more forgiving file edit tool. Three-stage matching tolerates
Unicode/whitespace drift and gives rich diagnostics on failure.

## Why

The built-in `edit` fails on invisible-byte differences (Unicode arrows,
tab↔space, indentation drift) and gives opaque diagnostics on failure ("Could
not find the exact text"). This burns agent turns — a single failed edit cuts
recovery probability by a third (SWE-agent NeurIPS 2024 data).

## What's different

**Matching** — three-stage cascade (consensus across Codex, OpenCode, Octofs):
1. Exact whole-string match (tried first — zero cost when the model is precise)
2. Normalized fuzzy match (arrows → ASCII, tab↔space, smart quotes/dashes,
   special spaces, trailing whitespace) with indentation auto-adjust
3. Closest-match diagnostics (never applies — just reports)

**Diagnostics** — on failure, returns the closest match with similarity % and
line number, plus occurrence lines with surrounding context (grep -C style).
When multiple exact matches exist, also reports **normalized-equal occurrences**
with different whitespace (near-misses the exact match missed). All edits in a
call are validated before any file is written (atomic), and every failure is
reported so the model fixes all in one retry.

**Disambiguation** — `anchor` (a unique nearby string, self-validating) picks
the right occurrence; `replaceAll` for all of them. No line numbers required
(models are bad at counting).

**Multi-file** — set `path` per-edit to target different files; atomic across
all via nested `withFileMutationQueue`.

**dryRun** — preview matches + diff without writing.

**Diff-as-result** — successful edits return the full diff in the result
text (for LLM self-verification), plus the line each edit landed on
(`edits[N] → line X`, with an `(anchored)` tag when an anchor disambiguated
among near-identical sites). Not just the TUI.

**No-op detection** — an edit whose `oldText` and `newText` are identical (a
common paste-the-same-thing-on-both-sides typo) is flagged as a no-op and
fails the batch atomically, instead of silently counting as applied. Catches
the failure that inflates the applied-count and hides what actually changed.

**Duplicate-line guard** — detects when the model includes surrounding unchanged
lines in its replacement (would silently double on disk).

## Parameters

| Param | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | yes (top-level) | File to edit; overridden per-edit |
| `edits[]` | yes | `{ oldText, newText, path?, anchor?, replaceAll? }` |
| `dryRun` | no | Report without writing |

## Correctness invariants

- **Original bytes preserved.** Normalized matches widen to whole lines and
  rewrite only touched line groups; all other lines keep their original bytes.
  Unicode in untouched regions is never mangled.
- **Atomic application.** Validate-all-first; if any edit fails, nothing is
  written across any file.
- **No staleness gate.** `old_string` is the consistency check; the per-file
  mutation queue handles concurrent edits. A gate would cause false positives
  (formatter touches an unrelated region → forced re-read).

## Permission gate integration

The permission gate skips confirmation for doomed edits (preview fails, edits
don't match) and `dryRun` — the tool will throw diagnostics naturally, no
point asking the user to approve. Only shows the confirm dialog when the
preview succeeds (all edits matched, a real write is pending).

## Files

- `match.ts` — pure matching engine (cascade, anchor, replaceAll, overlap
  detection, byte preservation). No pi imports.
- `diagnostics.ts` — pure diagnostics (closest match, occurrence context with
  `>>` markers, near-miss detection, duplicate-line guard, message formatting).
  No pi imports.
- `preview.ts` — diff preview for the permission gate (uses patch's own
  matcher, not pi's computeEditsDiff).
- `match.test.ts` / `diagnostics.test.ts` — tests covering the HarnessKit
  matrix (whitespace, Unicode, indentation, stale context) plus anchor,
  replaceAll, overlap, byte-preservation, duplicate-line guard, near-miss
  detection, and no-op detection.
- `index.ts` — pi integration shell (tool registration, multi-file via nested
  withFileMutationQueue, atomic validate-all-first, path auto-lift, dryRun,
  post-exec diff, live preview in renderCall, self-contained error messages).
