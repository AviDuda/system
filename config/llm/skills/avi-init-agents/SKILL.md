# Initialize or Update AGENTS.md

Create or update AI agent instructions for the current directory.

## Mode Detection

1. Check if `AGENTS.md` exists in the current directory
2. **Exists**: Run update mode (review against checklist)
3. **Missing**: Run create mode (explore and generate)

## Create Mode

### Step 1: Determine Scope

Is this for a project root or a subdirectory?

**Subdirectory AGENTS.md considerations:**
- AI agents inherit instructions from all AGENTS.md files from the current file up to filesystem root
- Subdirectory AGENTS.md should only contain what's *different* from the parent - don't repeat
- If a subdirectory needs its own AGENTS.md, it probably also needs its own README
- Good candidates: monorepo packages, distinct subsystems, areas with different conventions

Ask the user if unclear whether this should be root-level or subdirectory-scoped.

### Step 2: Explore the Project

Discover what kind of project this is:

**Build system indicators:**
- `package.json`, `bun.lock` → Node/Bun project, look for scripts
- `Cargo.toml` → Rust project
- `go.mod` → Go project
- `flake.nix`, `mise.toml` → Check for task definitions
- `Makefile`, `justfile` → Build commands

**Project type indicators:**
- `.obsidian/` → Knowledge vault - look for organization patterns, existing AI commands
- Game-related structure, design docs → Game project - check for hidden mechanics to protect
- `flake.nix` + `modules/` → Config repo - look for rebuild commands, module structure

**Existing documentation:**
- README and contributing guides
- Architecture docs
- Any `docs/` directory contents
- Inline code comments and conventions

**Existing AI instructions:**
- `.cursorrules`, `.cursor/rules/`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Tool-specific files without `AGENTS.md` (needs migration)
- AI instructions embedded in README

### Step 3: Identify Key Elements

Based on exploration, identify:

1. **Commands** (3-5 most common): build, test, lint, check, format
2. **Key paths**: where to add features, where tests go, config locations
3. **@-mention candidates**: files worth always-on context (look for coding conventions, testing guides, architecture overviews - but use whatever names the project actually has)
4. **Project context**: what kind of project, key constraints, philosophy
5. **LLM-specific gotchas**: things the AI might repeatedly get wrong

### Step 4: Check for Existing AI Instructions

If found (`.cursorrules`, copilot instructions, etc.):
- Note what they contain
- Options to suggest:
  - **Consolidate**: Migrate content into AGENTS.md, delete the old file
  - **Symlink**: If the tool requires its specific filename, symlink it to AGENTS.md (e.g., `ln -sf AGENTS.md .cursorrules`)
  - **Keep separate**: If team uses multiple AI tools with different needs
- When migrating, reframe negatives as positives

### Step 5: Generate AGENTS.md

**Structure** (adapt based on project - not all sections needed):

```markdown
# AGENTS.md

[One-line project description]

## Quick Reference

[3-5 most common commands]

## Key Paths

[Where to add things, task → file mapping]

## @-mentions (only if files warrant always-on context)

@path/to/actual/file.md

## Project Context

[What kind of project, key constraints, philosophy - only if non-obvious]

## Guidelines

[Prescriptive rules - what TO do, not what to avoid]
```

**Principles:**
- Keep it minimal - if it can be @-mentioned, don't inline it
- Prescriptive, not prohibitive - say what to do, not what to avoid
- LLM-focused - human docs go in README/docs
- No generic advice ("write tests", "use meaningful names")
- Use the project's actual file names, not hypothetical ones

### Step 6: Create Symlink

```bash
ln -sf AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
```

### Step 7: Suggest .local.md (if applicable)

If the project has private context (references to private files, personal planning docs, TODOs not in repo), suggest creating `AGENTS.local.md` with:
- Private file references
- Personal context
- Development notes not for public repo

And symlink: `ln -sf AGENTS.local.md CLAUDE.local.md`

**Verify gitignore** before creating — run `git check-ignore AGENTS.local.md CLAUDE.local.md`. If not ignored, suggest adding to `.gitignore` (local or global). These files are personal and should never be committed.

### Step 8: Suggest Missing Docs

If gaps found during exploration, describe what's missing by purpose:
- Development workflow documentation (if setup is complex)
- Code style/conventions guide (if not obvious from tooling config)
- Testing guide (if testing setup is non-trivial)
- Architecture overview (if structure isn't clear from directory layout)

Let the user choose filenames and locations. Don't create these docs - just note the gaps.

## Nested AGENTS.md

When creating AGENTS.md for a subdirectory:

1. **Check parent AGENTS.md** - what's already covered?
2. **Only include differences** - subdirectory-specific commands, paths, conventions
3. **Consider scope** - if this subdir is complex enough for AGENTS.md, suggest:
   - README for the subdirectory
   - Any other docs that would help humans too
4. **Keep it short** - inherited context + subdirectory context shouldn't be overwhelming

## Update Mode

When AGENTS.md already exists, review it against the checklist.

See @checklist.md for the full review process.

Quick checks:
1. Are there negatives to reframe? ("Don't do X" → "Do Y instead")
2. Are @-mentions still valid and useful?
3. Is there stale content that no longer applies?
4. Are there missing sections based on current project state?
5. Is the symlink setup correct?

## Reframing Negatives

When you encounter prohibitive language, reframe as prescriptive:

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "Don't add frameworks" | "Use vanilla TypeScript" |
| "Don't over-engineer" | "Keep solutions minimal" |
| "Don't skip type checking" | "Run type checks before committing" |
| "Don't expose hidden state" | "Keep hidden state internal" |
| "Avoid marketing language" | "Use direct, technical language" |

The goal is instructions that tell the AI what TO do, creating a positive model to follow rather than a list of mistakes to avoid.
